    "In this notebook we will see how we can add Attention to a simple Convolutional Neural Network. Each spatial location of the feature map within the network will be able to query every other location. As every input can query every other input in the \"sequence\" (here the input sequence is the sequence of spatial locations) we call this type of Attention \"Self\" Attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that Convolutions operate locally over the spatial dimensions of our input. This means the receptive field of a feature in the output feature map has a receptive field of a very small part of the input. In order for the output of the very last convolution layer to have a receptive field of the whole input, we need to stack many convolution layers, hence the structure of a CNN. However this means that many Convolution layers early in the network can only operate on a small part of the input. Self Attention provides a way (with minimal parameters) to \"Mix\" all of the spatial locations so that all features have information about the whole input early on in the network!"
